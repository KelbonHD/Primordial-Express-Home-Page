# Primordial-Express-Home-Page
Website testing my abilities with flexbox. A Codecademy Project.

This is a codecademy project I skipped for a while since I wanted to expand my skills in Web Development a bit further before making a company home page.
I wanted it to be of better quality, and have some javascript incorporated as well.
